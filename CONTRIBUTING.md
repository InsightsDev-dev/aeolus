# Contributing guidelines
Contributions are welcome. Send a pull request on [github.com] or a patch per mail if you have or insist to.
## Code formatting
Code formatting is done automatically with `uncrustify` which you can configure like you want to in `uncrustify.cfg` or with `universalindentgui`. Please avoid whitespace in HTML elements (e.g. don't write `<br />` because `uncrustify can't handle it.
